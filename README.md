# programming_journey
Setting sail on the ocean of code. Anchors aweigh!
I started out programming macros in Excel by recording macros then editting them to make them fit what I wanted them to do. This led into Google Sheet scripting, stand alone Google Script and UI, HTML, native Javascript, CSS and now I am launching into Ruby and Rails. It is exciting to manipulate electrons to produce applications that simplify and solve process needs. Looking forward to the journey. Travis
